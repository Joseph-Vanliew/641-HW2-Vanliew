## <span id="Technical Background">Technical Background</span>
1 year Backend, Cloud Applications Programming, and Algorithms coursework from SNHU 2022-2023. Focused on programming in Java. Course projects focused on webapps and AWS service utilizations such as Lambda, DynamoDB, CloudWatch, Pipeline, etc. Solid foundational experience coming from a non CS Degree background. Recent projects from GVSU have included some frontend experience in JS, HTML CSS and REACT. Major backend frameworks have been SpringBoot and Hibernate. Build Tools include Gradle and Maven. Familiar with npm and brew.

Other recent work has been done in Python (in Colab) for my machine learning and data engineering classes including working with many relational and non-relational db's. Familiar with Anaconda's package management as well.

Some work during an HPC course using C and CPP for some parallelization and resource utliziation. \
A Petri-Net project written in Java with a React framework frontend that works WORKS!.... However the frontend is still incomplete. Tested thoroughly for its next state processing function. Although it could be more thorough. Probably need to look at my boundary analysis and mutations again.

A real time communication app is something most every single person woorking professionally or going through school uses everyday. WebRTC and Go are new technologies to the team and present an exciting opportunity for testing the capabilities of the team. A user will be able to create and initiate meetings and chat sessions with anyone they share a link with.
