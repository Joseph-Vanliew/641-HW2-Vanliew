## Technical Background

1 year Backend, Cloud Applications Programming, and Algorythms coursework from SNHU 2022-2023. Focused on
programming in Java. Course projects focused on webapps and AWS service utilizations such as
Lambda, DynamoDB, CloudWatch, Pipeline, etc. Solid foundational experience coming from a non 
CS Degree background. Recent projects from GVSU have included some frontend experience in JS,
HTML CSS and REACT. Major backend frameworks have been SpringBoot and Hibernate. Build Tools include Gradle
and Maven. Familiar with npm and brew. 

Other recent work has been done in Python (in Colab) for my machine learning and data engineering classes including 
working with many relational and non-relational db's. Familiar with Anaconda's package management as well. 

Some work during an HPC course using C and CPP for some parallelization and resource utliziation. 

A Petri-Net project written in Java with a React framework frontend that ~~works~~ **WORKS!**.... However the frontend is still
incomplete. Tested thoroughly for its next state processing function. Although it could be *more* thorough. Probably
need to look at my boundary analysis and mutations again.
